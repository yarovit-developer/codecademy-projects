# Pinpoint E-Commerce
In this project, you will use the knowledge you gained within the Color for UI lesson and apply it to an e-commerce checkout page. You will take an existing grayscale website and apply colors to various elements and sections within the design to ensure users understand the error and active states as well as primary calls-to-action.
