# CodeOverflow Forum

In this project, we will build the beginnings of a web forum! A forum is an online discussion board where users can exchange their opinions on a variety of topics. The most important component of a forum is the comment section. This is what weâ€™ll work on in this project.

In building this application, you will sharpen your skills in React components by practicing using props as well as defining, rendering, and referencing components.
