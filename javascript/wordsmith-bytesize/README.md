# WordSmith and ByteSize

## Description

This project showcases the use of two APIs: the **Datamuse API** for finding related words and the **Rebrandly API** for URL shortening. The project consists of two key functionalities:

1. **WordSmith**: A word suggestion tool that fetches words related to a given input from the Datamuse API and displays them on the webpage.
2. **ByteSize**: A URL shortener that uses the Rebrandly API to shorten a user-provided URL and display the shortened link on the webpage.

### Key Features
- **WordSmith**: Fetches and displays a list of words related to the input word.
- **ByteSize**: Shortens a user-provided URL using Rebrandly API and displays the shortened URL on the page.
- **Asynchronous Requests**: Both functions make use of JavaScript's `fetch` API to send asynchronous requests and handle the responses.

To use ByteSize you will need a Rebrandly API key. To do this, read through [the Rebrandly sign up guide](https://developers.rebrandly.com/docs) to set up your API.
