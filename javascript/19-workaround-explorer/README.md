# WorkAround Explorer

**WorkAround** is a research organization that provides data on salary trends in the tech industry. Open up `salaryData.js` to see the data they have collected. Youâ€™ll notice that they have also created a few functions for filtering that data to get subsets of data by role and by company.

## Project Requirements

WorkAround now wants to release a new web application called **WorkAround Explorer** to make their data more easily viewable. This web app should allow users to choose specific roles and companies in the tech industry to see the following information:

### Features

1. **Salary for the Chosen Role at the Chosen Company**
   - Display the salary for a selected job role at a specific company.

2. **Industry Average for the Chosen Role**
   - Show the average salary for the selected job role across the industry.

3. **Average Salary at the Chosen Company Across All Roles**
   - Calculate and display the average salary for the chosen company, regardless of job role.

4. **Industry Average Salary Across All Roles and All Companies**
   - Provide the average salary across the industry for all job roles and companies.
